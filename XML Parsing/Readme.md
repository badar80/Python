# XML Parser

## What the project does

This code uses the ElementTree library in Python to parse an XML, strips out the names and ages from it and store this information in a dictionary

## Why the project is useful

It can efficiently extract data from the hard-to-read XML files, the data can later be written to CSVs or pushed to a database

## How users can get started with the project

Ensure that the ElementTree module is installed and the XML file that you want parsing is stored in the relevant directory and that this directory is given in the code. The 'data.xml' file is given as a test input file.
