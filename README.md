# Forex Trading Strategy Backtester

## What the project does

This Python code allows you to import historical forex (foreign exchange) data and backtest various trading strategies by looping through thousands of combinations of Simple Moving Average (SMA) values. The code then generates a file that displays the overall profits of each strategy in descending order of profitability, along with the corresponding SMA combinations.

## Why the project is useful

Forex trading is a complex and dynamic market, and developing profitable trading strategies can be challenging. This project is useful for traders and developers who want to automate the process of testing different SMA-based trading strategies to identify potentially profitable combinations. By backtesting historical data, users can gain insights into the performance of their strategies and make data-driven decisions when trading forex.

## How users can get started with the project

**Import Historical Forex Data**: Obtain historical forex data in CSV format or use the sample data provided in the repository. Place the data in the relevant directory. This Historical data can either be found online, or downloaded from a variety of FX broker platforms by downloading the platform and navigating to the files section and export data options.
